Despite today's computers' performance
there still exist some tasks that are quite time demanding. Nature of some
of these tasks allows to split them into smaller parts that can be processed in parallel.
Distributing work among more computers in order to speed up the process is a common
technique. However, most of the approaches use client-server architecture
to achieve this goal. We provide purely peer-to-peer solution which
allows high level of scalability, error recovery and easy maintaining.
No special role is needed in our framework and each node can join the network in any time. Also
the system is able to deal with node failures, keeping the overall computation time reasonable.
Tests showed that significant improvement can be achieved in local area networks.
